            <h2>Our Classes:</h2>
                <h4>FOUNDATIONS</h4>
                In this class the basic, foundational yoga postures are practiced to align, strengthen and promote flexibility in the body. Breathing techniques and meditation are also integrated. You can expect an emphasis on simplicity, repetition, and ease of movement. Full-body relaxation and balance are the goals, as we make a full circuit of the body’s range of motion with standing postures, twists, backbends, forward folds, and hip openers. Beginner level/Basic.<br/><br/>
                <h4>SLOW FLOW and RESTORE</h4>
                This class will flow slowly through sun salutations and postures designed to build internal heat slowly and gently.  Meditation and Pranaymana (breath work) techniques are taught to promote relaxation.  Class concludes with Restorative Yoga postures which settle the body and mind. All levels.<br/><br/>
                <h4>VINYASA and HATHA FLOW</h4>
                Vinyasa ( translates to “flowing with breath”) is a dynamic style of Hatha yoga which joins physical postures, or asanas, with inhales and exhales, creating a steady internal rhythm for the practice. Our Flow classes are designed to cultivate heat in the body with creative sequences involving sun salutations, standing and seated postures, back bending, arm balancing, and a strong focus on the power of breath awareness. Flow yoga classes tend to be more vigorous and aerobic, and classes can have a variety of music and themes.<br/>
